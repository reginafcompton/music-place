    <h4>Music and Place</h4>
    <p>Social, political, and physical context can influence, indeed, determine the nature of musical works and practices. Just as well, music can shape the spaces that it occupies. "Music and Place" – a seminar for adult learners at <a href="https://www.newberry.org/adult-education-seminars" target="_blank">The Newberry</a> – examines this ever-meaningful dialogue between music and the spaces in which it resides.</p>
    <h4>What will you learn?</h4>
    <p>This seminar covers a broad temporal and geographical scope. Each class session focuses on a unique place during a distinct musico-historical moment, beginning in the the Baroque era and concluding in the twentieth century. The course starts in Venice in the seventeenth century. During this period, the city housed the first public opera houses, for which composers and librettists devised works intended specifically for Venetian audiences. The following session examines London in the eighteenth century, a period of prosperity for “opera seria” and also its comedic imitation: ballad opera. Students will explore the tensions and rivalry between serious and less-than-serious operatic works on London stages.</p>
    <p>The final sessions turn to sizeable but likely familiar topics: Richard Wagner and Soviet Russia. At the end of the nineteenth century, Wagner famously erected a theater in Bayreuth precisely designed to house his great operatic cycle The Ring. In this session, students look into the history of the theater, Wagner’s music, and just as importantly, the Wagner family dynasty that continues to govern, affect, and complicate music today. The final class session investigates the totalitarian regime of Stalin’s Soviet Russia, which policed and consequently transformed the musical arts into state propaganda. In particular, students will consider the biography and works of Dmitri Shostakovich, who spent his entire life in Russia, composing music that adhered to but sometimes challenged socialist principles.

    <h4>And . . . why?</h4>
    <p>Music is not autonomous, existing in an aesthetic vacuum. Music does work: it participates in networks of people, ideas, and places. This seminar gives a broad overview of music history, but just as importantly, this course acknowledges, confronts, and seeks to understand the close relationship between music and its contexts.
