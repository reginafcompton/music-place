  <h2>PARIS IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD</h2>
  <h4>October 22</h4>
  <p>In this first session, we investigate the earliest blossoming of notated polyphonic music, cultivated specifically for the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris during the Medieval period.</p>
  <p>This week, read select pages from the <em>Oxford History of Western Music</em> by Richard Taruskin (click link below), which gives an overview of the culture of Paris in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In addition, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aySwfcRaOZM" target="_blank">"Viderunt omnes"</a> by Perotin (c. 1170) performed by the Hilliard Ensemble. If time permits, explore other performances of music by Perotin and his contemporary Leonin.</p>

  <h2>VENICE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY</h2>
  <h4>October 29</h4>
  <p>This class session considers the origins, characteristics, and context of seventeenth-century Venetian opera. Before class, read excerpts by Ellen Rosand, who provides a rigorous digest of opera in Venice and dissects the meaning of <em>L'incoronazione di Poppea</em> by Claudio Monteverdi. This class also considers in detail the music and plot of <em>Poppea</em>. Find any synopsis of the opera online; Wikipedia works fine, in this case. Then, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyQqJANZqe4" target="_blank">Act 1, Scene 6</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0L1CJBj0GE" target="_blank">Act 1, Scene 9</a>. (N.B. The videos do not have English subtitles: the goal is simply to familiarize yourself with the soundworld of this opera.)</p>

  <h2>LONDON IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h2>
  <h4>November 5</h4>
  <p>This class session considers eighteenth-century London, where “opera seria” and its comedic imitation – ballad opera – energized audiences, composers, and social satirists throughout the city. For this session, read Forrest's vivid description of London entertainment, and then consider the synopsis of <em>The Beggar's Opera</em>, a provocative reaction to Italian opera in England. Explore YouTube, Spotify, or any audio library of your choice for performances of <em>The Beggar's Opera</em>, but consider especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uli5SyYexwQ" target="_blank">Act 1, No. 14</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkj8HUk83rY" target="_blank">Act 1, No. 15</a>.</p>

  <h2>RUSSIA IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</h2>
  <h4>November 19</h4>
  <p>This final class looks at music and culture during the totalitarian regime of Stalin, whose administration transformed the musical arts into state propaganda.

In particular, this session will focus on the biography and works of Dmitri Shostakovich, who spent his entire life in Russia. Listen to the last movement of his <a href="https://youtu.be/r0AK_50-9rQ?t=37m44s" target="_blank">Fifth Symphony</a>, a product of totalitarian oppression, both in its practicality and also its hidden defiance.</p>
